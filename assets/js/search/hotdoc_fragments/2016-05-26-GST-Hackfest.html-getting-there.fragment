Strangely enough my girlfriend, who when I went to the Staines (near London) hackfest\nonly asked when I'd come back, was already packing her swimsuit this time.\nAfter a one-day stop in Venice (fortunately not too crowded at this time of year), and a three-day visit of Dubrovnik aka King's landing,\nour intention was to get to Thessaloniki through Albania and arrive on the evening before the hackfest started. Albanian customs, however, didn't seem to share this intention at all,\nand we ended up having to cross Montenegro from South to North, get in Serbia, go East and be refused entry in Kosovo, go East again and finally get to Thessaloniki through Macedonia.\nNeedless to say we arrived at 10 A.M. on the day the hackfest started.\nI briefly logged in to the IRC channel, told everyone I'd have to be excused for the day, got greeted by Edward Hervey mumbling stuff about \"equations everywhere\", and\nothers suggesting I should have engaged in bribery (I will not name names here), logged off and slept for 15 hours.\n"});
