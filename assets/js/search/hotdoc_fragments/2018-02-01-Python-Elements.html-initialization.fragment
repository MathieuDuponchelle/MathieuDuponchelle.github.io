We only declare\nand (re)initialize other variables in the do_start virtual method\nimplementation.\nNote that linters might complain when attributes are declared outside of\nthe __init__ function, as we do in the do_start virtual method, if you\nwish to strictly comply you will want to declare them in __init__ as well,\nwe didn't do so here for the sake of brevity.\nAs our base class declares a start vmethod, we implement it by defining\na do_start method in our class.\n"});
