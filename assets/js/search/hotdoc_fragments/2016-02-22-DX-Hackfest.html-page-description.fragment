I m still a bit confused as to why this limitation would exist as the proposed solution involved exposing a D Bus service but I m sure we ll find a better solution when we need to. \nI discussed the future of https developer.gnome.org with the documentation team. They liked the search interface in hotdoc it does work quite well and we all agreed that a tighter integration with actual API references would be nice to have amongst various other things online editing for example \nThe website is currently implemented as a series of mallard pages. Hotdoc does not read mallard pages and it isn t part of my current plans. A possible way forward would be to drop mallard altogether and have all the pages be hotdoc flavored markdown pages. I think this could make sense because \nI have since then implemented a simple pandoc reader and used it to make a very naive port of gnome devel docs the result can be seen here \nThis port is naive because I made absolutely no manual edits to the produced markdown files which explains why the index page looks pretty ugly but pages like https people.collabora.com meh dgo_hotdoc html overview media.html are pretty faithful to the source and it would mostly be a matter of custom CSS and trivial edits to get the thing to really look good. \nYou can have a look at the generated markdown files here. \nPhilip Chimento has been working on a fork of devdocs in an effort to create a javascriot developer portal for GNOME. I see some drawbacks with his approach which we ve discussed together and I will not detail here but overall his current solution has the advantage of code reuse and lightweightness as the output is generated stictly from gir files. \nMy opinion on this is that his work is a nice short term solution to a clear problem gathering together the javascript documentation for most all GNOME libraries and I suggested linking to it on the current portal. \nHowever I think the design of devdocs and his solution will fall short for the long term requirements that the GNOME documentation team seems to set and Philip seemed to agree. \nThis is still a very open issue and Philip and I definitely intend to work together to provide the best possible experience for GNOME hackers newbies and senior alike. \n"});
