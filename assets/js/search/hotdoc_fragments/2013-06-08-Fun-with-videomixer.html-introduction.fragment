It needed some love, and still needs,\nbut I've been able to fix some of the issues we had.\nWhen we first ported gstreamer-editing-services and gnonlin to gstreamer 1.0, even the most basic editing became impossible.\nThat was quite frustrating to say the least, and being able to do edition once again feels extremely good !\nOne of the great things with the extraction of pitivi's edition code to GES is that you can now write fancy scripts to make\nautomated edition, and with a little luck you won't encounter a bug on your way.\nAt the end of this article, you will find a video showing an example result.\nThere haven't been much tutorials about using GES, the only way to learn that is either looking at the examples on the git repo,\nor to directly look at pitivi's source code.\nWith that blogpost I'm gonna try to present that cool library, while coding something fun. The idea from the script came from\nthat video : http://vimeo.com/35770492, linked to me by Nicolas Dufresne. We won't be able to reproduce the most advanced\nbits of this video, as it also seems to be content-aware at some points, but we will make a fun script nevertheless !\n"});
