While it is\nbased on RFC 2733, flexfec is based on RFC 5109 and lifts some of the\nconstraints I listed earlier. Flexfec is not yet a final RFC, but it can\nalready be used as a webRTC protection mechanism with Google Chrome, and\nshould eventually obsolete ulpfec.\nIf you are interested in building upon my work to implement flexfec or\nSMPTE 2022-5 support in GStreamer, or are willing to sponsor me for doing so,\ndon't hesitate to shoot me a mail at mathieu@centricular.com!\n"});
