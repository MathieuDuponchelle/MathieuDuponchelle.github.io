They liked the search interface in hotdoc (it does work quite well :), and we all agreed that a tighter integration with actual API references would be nice to have, amongst various other things (online editing for example).\nThe website is currently implemented as a series of mallard pages. Hotdoc does not read mallard pages, and it isn't part of my current plans. A possible way forward would be to drop mallard altogether, and have all the pages be \"hotdoc-flavored\" markdown pages. I think this could make sense because:\nI have since then implemented a simple pandoc reader, and used it to make a very naive port of gnome-devel-docs, the result can be seen here\nThis port is naive because I made absolutely no manual edits to the produced markdown files, which explains why the index page looks pretty ugly, but pages like https://people.collabora.com/~meh/dgo_hotdoc/html/overview-media.html are pretty faithful to the source, and it would mostly be a matter of custom CSS and trivial edits to get the thing to really look good.\nYou can have a look at the generated markdown files here.\n\ngnome-devel-docs doesn't make an extensive use of mallard.\nmarkdown pages present a significantly lower barrier to entry, and most people are familiar with the syntax.\nthe developer site and the API references it would link to would share the same format for standalone documentation source files.\n\n"});
