The element stated that it would output\na specific format on its source pad, and its base classes handled the rest.\nFor this example however, the element will accept a wide range of input formats,\nand propose a wide range of output formats as well:\nLet's see what gst-inspect-1.0 tells us about its pad templates here:\nThe element states that it can accept any audio format, with any rate and any\nnumber of channels, the only restriction that we place is that samples should\nbe interleaved.\nOn the output side, once again we place a single restriction, and state that\nthe element will only be able to output ARGB data, this because ARGB is the\nonly alpha-capable pixel format the matplotlib API we will use proposes.\n"});
