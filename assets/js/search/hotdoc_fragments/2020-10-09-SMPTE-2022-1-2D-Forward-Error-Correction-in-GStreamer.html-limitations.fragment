As a consequence,\nit is often used with an MPEG-TS container, but nothing prevents from using\nit with other types of payload. SMPTE 2022-1 also prohibits usage of CSRC\nentries.\nThe maximum size of the 2D FEC matrix is limited to 255 by 255. This is of\ncourse more than sufficient for compressed formats, but too limiting for\nraw formats. SMPTE 2022-5 addresses this by turning the row and column fields\ninto 10-bit values, making it suitable for usage with very high bandwidth\nformats (> 3 Gbps).\n"});
