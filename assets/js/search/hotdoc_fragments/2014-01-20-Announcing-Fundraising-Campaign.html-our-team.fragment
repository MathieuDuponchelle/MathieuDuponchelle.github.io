I've loved\nevery moment I've spent in the community, I've made friends, I've learnt good engineering practices, how to fit in a team, how\nto communicate clearly, and so much more I can't even start to list.\nNot gonna tell the whole story because that would be boring to write and even more to read, but eventually and naturally\nI became a maintainer alongside Thibault and Jean-François. Jean-François has been around the project for 10 years now, he's awesome,\na really dedicated guy. Thibault and I are friends since a long time, well before I started programming, I've been his padawan for the\nbest part of my initiation to programming and Free Software, and he's a great Jedi !\nRecently, Alexandru Balut has also started to work with us again, I don't know him as closely as I know Jeff and Thib, but he's\ncommited so much things in the last two months that we've had a hard time reviewing it and preparing the campaign at the same time !\nI don't know him as well on a personal level as I know Jeff and Thibault, but I like working with him a lot, he makes great and\nclean patches and has a seemingly boundless dedication to cleaning up the code and making it elegant.\nAll this to say I'm proud and happy to be part of such a team. Free Software's most important asset isn't the code, the bug\ntrackers, the continuous integration servers, it's the people, and these folks are great, I can't stress that enough.\n"});
