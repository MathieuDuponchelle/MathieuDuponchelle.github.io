This time the place was Thessaloniki and the people were GStreamer developers. \nI hadn t taken any vacation since I ve started working for Collabora two years ago mandatory geez time flies apart from one day or two for Christmas related activities so I decided I d take two weeks and do a little road trip across Europe. Strangely enough my girlfriend who when I went to the Staines near London hackfest only asked when I d come back was already packing her swimsuit this time. \nAfter a one day stop in Venice fortunately not too crowded at this time of year and a three day visit of Dubrovnik aka King s landing our intention was to get to Thessaloniki through Albania and arrive on the evening before the hackfest started. Albanian customs however didn t seem to share this intention at all and we ended up having to cross Montenegro from South to North get in Serbia go East and be refused entry in Kosovo go East again and finally get to Thessaloniki through Macedonia. \nNeedless to say we arrived at A.M. on the day the hackfest started. \nI briefly logged in to the IRC channel told everyone I d have to be excused for the day got greeted by Edward Hervey mumbling stuff about equations everywhere and others suggesting I should have engaged in bribery I will not name names here logged off and slept for hours. \nI arrived at the hackfest to find a nice two storey building reserved for our usage and Lubosz Sarnecki in the middle of kilometers of cables and enough hardware to open a small VR shop. He needed a powerful GPU to set up the leapmotion s blocks demo and we figured my laptop would do the trick. We set everything up then struggled for some time until accepting it really wouldn t be up to the task. \nWe ended up borrowing a desktop PC which proved to be up to the task and after some fiddling the demo was finally set up and working smoothly. \nIt was well worth the wait leapmotion s tech is amazing and after some time making and manipulating blocks whoever isn t convinced about the future of VR might well reconsider I m really curious to see the games people will come up with a VR remake of Black White would be pretty awesome if you ask me. \nMore to the point Lubosz is currently writing a GStreamer video filter to transform streams for Insert VR headset here consumption but as far as I understand his work is still in progress and not yet demoable. \nIt was already late and after a few people had taken turns trying out the demo the day was already gone. \nMy original goal for this hackfest was to implement a hotdoc extension for documenting GStreamer plugins but with one day left that was hardly a completable goal and after talking with Tim Philipp M ller it appeared he had more immediate concerns in terms of documentation namely porting existing content to markdown. I briefly talked him into sticking to the CommonMark specification and using hotdoc to arrange it all together. Olivier Crete started porting the contents of gstreamer.com and I started work on the Plugin Writer s manual. \nIt was decided a new repository for the documentation would be created and that we would update https gstreamer.freedesktop.org incrementally with its contents once maintainers are happy with the proposed solution. I still need to finalize my port of the manual hopefully by the end of this week I ll have something decent to propose. \nI m afraid I don t have much to report on the GStreamer side of the GStreamer hackfest hopefully others will fill that gap I ll update this page with links to other people s posts. \n"});
