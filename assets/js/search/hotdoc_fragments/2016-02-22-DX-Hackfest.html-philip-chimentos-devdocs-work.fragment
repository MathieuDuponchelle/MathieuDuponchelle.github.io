I see some drawbacks with his approach, which we've discussed together and I will not detail here, but overall his current solution has the advantage of code reuse, and lightweightness, as the output is generated stictly from gir files.\nMy opinion on this is that his work is a nice short-term solution to a clear problem (gathering together the javascript documentation for most (all ?) GNOME libraries, and I suggested linking to it on the current portal.\nHowever I think the design of devdocs and his solution will fall short for the long-term requirements that the GNOME documentation team seems to set, and Philip seemed to agree.\nThis is still a very open issue, and Philip and I definitely intend to work together to provide the best possible experience for GNOME hackers, newbies and senior alike.\n"});
