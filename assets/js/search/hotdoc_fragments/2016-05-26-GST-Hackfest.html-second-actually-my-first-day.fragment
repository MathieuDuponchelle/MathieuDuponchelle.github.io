We set everything up, then struggled for some time until accepting it really wouldn't be up to the task.\nWe ended up borrowing a desktop PC, which proved to be up to the task, and after some fiddling the demo was finally set up and working smoothly.\nIt was well worth the wait: leapmotion's tech is amazing, and after some time making and manipulating blocks, whoever isn't convinced about the future of VR might well\nreconsider! I'm really curious to see the games people will come up with, a VR remake of Black & White would\nbe pretty awesome if you ask me.\nMore to the point, Lubosz is currently writing a GStreamer video filter to transform streams for [Insert VR headset here] consumption, but as far as I understand\nhis work is still in progress, and not yet demoable.\nIt was already late, and after a few people had taken turns trying out the demo, the day was already gone.\n"});
