Given a set of N values, it is possible to recover any\nof the values provided all the other values and the result of their xoring\ntogether have been received.\nIt is logically equivalent and probably easier to think of to retrieving\nthe missing value when the sum of all the values has been received, for\nexample given 3 values 1, 2 and X, and their sum 6, we can see that X must\nbe:\nUsage of XOR is a neat trick that makes for a more computer-friendly mechanism:\nwhile an addition-based mechanism would require 9-bit to protect two 8-bit\nvalues, 10-bit to protect 4, etc., the required size with XOR remains a constant\n8-bit.\nAn RTP payload is just a collection of 8-bit values, so it follows that the\npayload of FEC packets protecting N RTP packets consists of an equivalent\namount of 8-bit values.\nOther fields of the standard RTP header are protected similarly, such as\nthe payload type or the timestamp, and the payload length of the media\npackets as well, allowing the mechanism to be applied to media packets\nof varying lengths.\n"});
