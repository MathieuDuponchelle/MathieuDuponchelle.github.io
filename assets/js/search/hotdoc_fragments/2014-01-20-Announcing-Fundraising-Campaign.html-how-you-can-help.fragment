Fortunately I also have the spinning social widgets to cheer me up a bit, but it's not\nexactly enough to get me rid of my anxiousness.\nI know that what we do is right, and that requesting money for stabilization first is the correct and honest thing to do.\nObviously, I hope that you will donate to the campaign, but I also hope that after taking the time to read that rather\nlengthy blogpost in its entirety, you will be able to spread the message, and explain why what we do is important and good.\nFree and Open Source video editing is something that can help make the world a better place, as it gives people all\naround the world one more tool to express themselves, fight oppression, create happiness and spread love.\nHoping you'll spread the love too, thanks for reading !\n"});
