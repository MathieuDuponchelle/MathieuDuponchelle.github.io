The python plugin loader implemented\nby gst-python will import our module, and look for an attribute with\nthe well-known name __gstelementfactory__.\nThe value of this attribute should be a tuple consisting of a factory-name,\na rank, and the class that implements the element.\nIf the module needs to register multiple elements, it can do so by\nassigning a tuple of such tuples instead.\nThe class that we register is expected to hold a __gstmetadata__ class\nattribute:\nThe contents of this tuple will be used to call\ngst_element_class_set_metadata, you'll find more information in\nits documentation\n"});
