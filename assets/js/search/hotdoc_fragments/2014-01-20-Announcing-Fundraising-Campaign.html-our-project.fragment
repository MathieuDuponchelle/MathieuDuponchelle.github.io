Give it a second thought and you'll realize the hygrometry\nof that region is absolutely not appropriate, give it a third one for good measure then forget about it.\nI'll briefly explain what it is that makes of the Pitivi project the most exciting open source video editing project in my\nvery humble opinion.\nThe reason goes down to our design choices. We've played the long game, and based ourselves on the gstreamer set of\nlibraries and plugins. For a visual and greatly simplified explanation of how that choice is a good thing, you can refer\nto this animation, then have a look at the\nimpressive list of plugins that we can tap into.\nGStreamer is where most of the companies interested in open source multimedia invest their money and their time, it's where\nmost of the exciting stuff happens and it's definitely where an ambitious video editing application has to look at.\nWe also have made the choice of clearly splitting our editing core, our model, from our view, and made it a library,\nwith an awesome API, gstreamer-editing-services, directly usable from C, C++, javascript, python and every language\nsupported by introspection, and possibly any other language provided someone writes bindings for it.\nThat choice was the right one, decoupling components always pays off in the long term, and we are finally starting\nto see the benefits of that choice: Pitivi has seen its size divided by two, while gaining in stability.\nThis makes it much easier for new contributors to come in, and for us to maintain it.\ntl; dr: GStreamer rocks, and GES is great.\nWith that said, we are aware that the stabilization is not yet over. Pitivi is in a beta state, and it still needs intensive\nwork to make it so we kill the bugs and they never come back. To do this, we must extend our test suites, we must\ncontinue collaborating with GStreamer devs, we must create better ways for users to share with us failing scenarios. For all\nthis we've got great ideas, but what we miss is being able to work full-time on the project, which basically means we need\nmoney, for reasons I don't think I have to detail !\nI'm afraid this might sound a little boring, as we all tend to be more attracted to feature promises and shiny things,\nand that's obviously what we all deserve, but I think that's not what we need right now (hope I got the quote right).\nFortunately we estimate that phase to be around 6 months long for one person full time, we did a lot of the groundwork\nalready, and we just have to expand on that, and track the corner cases cause the devil is in the details, and he knows\nhow to hide damn well.\nAfter that, we will be ready to unleash GStreamer's power, and come up with great features in no time, and ride on the\nwork of others to get for example hardware acceleration basically for free. From that moment, when we'll have released\n1.0, things will get seriously real, and our backers will be able to vote on the features they care the most about.\nI've worked on the voting system and I think it's a great thing to have, I'm really impatient to see it used in real life\n(and hopefully not break), I think I'll write a more technical blogpost on its implementation.\n"});
