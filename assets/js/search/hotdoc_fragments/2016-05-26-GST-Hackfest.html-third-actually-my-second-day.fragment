I briefly talked him into sticking to the CommonMark specification, and using hotdoc to arrange it all\ntogether. Olivier Crete started porting the contents of gstreamer.com, and I started work on the Plugin Writer's manual.\nIt was decided a new repository for the documentation would be created, and that we would update https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/ incrementally\nwith its contents, once maintainers are happy with the proposed solution. I still need to finalize my port of the manual, hopefully by the end\nof this week I'll have something decent to propose.\n"});
